## Assignment description

Welcome to your first task for VCE Software Development! 🎉

The goal for this task is to start getting familiar with using GitHub and VSCode. You should already be familiar with some Python, but if not, you will learn how to print messages using Python as well. 💻🐍

### 📚 Learning intentions 

* Know how assignments can be accessed for class
* Know how tasks and assignments can be submitted for class
* Get an introduction to some professional software development tools

### 🎓 Success criteria

* You are reading this on your own computer
* You have installed VSCode on your computer, and downloaded this assignment
* You have written a _Hello World_ in Python, and pushed it to GitHub

## Instructions

1. Open the file explorer in VSCode with <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> (macOS)
1. Click on the `helloworld.py` file to open it
1. Add the following line of code to print the required message:

    ``` Python
    print('Hello World!')
    ```

1. Save the file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>S</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>S</kbd> (macOS)
1. Run the code with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>F5</kbd>

    _The terminal should open (if it is not already) and your program should output the message `Hello World!`._

1. If you are happy with your program, push it to GitHub:

    * open the source control sidebar with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>G</kbd>
    * under 'Changes', you should see the file you changed
    * press the '+' to stage the file
    * press the '✔' to commit the project
